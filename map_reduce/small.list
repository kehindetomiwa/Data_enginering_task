BG: He went to a local community college during the day where he obtained
BG: his adult high school diploma and joined the United States Army.
BG: 
BG: He found himself joining the military where he fought in the Infantry
BG: and forever tried to find a way back to the path to use his art. He is
BG: the type of person that has faced trial after trial but no matter how
BG: many times he has been knocked to the ground he has always managed to
BG: summon the strength to stand back up and face whatever the powers that
BG: be had to throw at him.
BG: 
BG: Trying to have a real family for once he married at 18 and had 2 sons by

BG: He was a single father and left the military where he would sell
BG: sketches and paint murals for income.
BG: 
BG: 3 years past and he built a sign and graphics company and then married a
BG: female that tried to take what he had worked so hard to build. They had
BG: one child together and during the divorce proceeding the wife told the
BG: judge "Sir he can have the child I just want the money!" Clark threw
BG: the keys to her from across the court room and kept his 3 sons
BG: together.
BG: 
BG: He lost everything again but then kept the thing that mattered
BG: most....his children.
BG: 
BG: With just an airbrush left he went to the beaches of the Carolina's and
BG: started painting t-shirts for money. This fine artist that seemed to
BG: channel the spirits of the masters had been reduced to doing whatever
BG: it took art wise to eat.
BG: 
BG: He found himself working night and day to provide for everyone and with
BG: the street smarts he possessed he managed to turn money over and open
BG: an airbrush shop in the mall. Three years past and he met a bi racial
BG: girl that was born and raised in Germany. They dated for a while and
BG: she seemed to be the only one that could tame the battle tossed artist.
BG: 
BG: They were married in 2005 and now Clark finally has his family and now
BG: with four sons.
BG: 
BG: Although, Clark, has been through so much he always remains positive and
BG: humble and true to his southern charm. His work is able to captivate
BG: people from all walks of life and crosses over to all races, religions
BG: and backgrounds. His art is now world wide and his clients include
BG: everyone from the Ruff Ryderz, Warren Sapp and the Hollywood Elite.
BG: 
BG: Mr. Clark does everything from acting, producing, writing screenplays,
BG: set painting, special effects make up, music; and even owns custom body
BG: shops and mall stores, as well as, his own Production Company.
BG: 
BG: Born and raised in the Carolina's of the United States he is a hardened
BG: and battle tossed soul that still displays the characteristics of a
BG: leader. One that does not drink or use drugs; he stands as a knight
BG: making sure others do not have to struggle and feel the pain that he
BG: has known.
